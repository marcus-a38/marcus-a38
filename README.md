I'm Marcus, a full-stack developer and student from Massachusetts.

Here's a little bit about me:

  - 💼 I am currently employed as a Manufacturing Services Admin intern at Infineon Technologies AG.
  - 💻 I am currently learning C#, ASP.NET, and web app development with Razor & Blazor.
  - 👍 As of late, my favorite programming language has been JavaScript.
  - 🌲 Outside of the world of computers, I enjoy gardening and hiking, especially with the company of my dog.
